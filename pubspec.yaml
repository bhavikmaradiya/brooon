# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/svg/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icon/
    - assets/json/
    - assets/font/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: OpenSans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-LightItalic.ttf
          weight: 300
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-MediumItalic.ttf
          weight: 500
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-SemiBoldItalic.ttf
          weight: 600
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-BoldItalic.ttf

          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-ExtraBoldItalic.ttf
          weight: 800
          style: italic

      fonts:
